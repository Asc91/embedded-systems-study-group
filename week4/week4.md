# Storage Classes in C

A storage class represents the visibility and a location of a variable. It tells from what part of code we can access a variable. 

A storage class is used to describe the following things:

- The variable scope.
- The location where the variable will be stored.
- The initialized value of a variable.
- A lifetime of a variable.
- Who can access a variable?

Thus a storage class is used to represent the information about a variable. A variable is not only associated with a data type, its value but also a storage class. 

## auto

- They are declared at the start of a programâ€™s block such as in the curly braces ( { } ). Memory is allocated automatically upon entry to a block and freed automatically upon exit from the block. 

- The scope of an auto variable is limited with the particular block only. Once the control goes out of the block, the access is destroyed. This means only the block in which the auto variable is declared can access it.

- The scope of automatic variables is local to the block in which they are declared, including any blocks nested within that block. For these reasons, they are also calledl local variables.

- No block outside the defining block may have direct access to automatic variables (by variable name) but, they may be accessed indirectly by other blocks and/or functions using pointers.

- Automatic variables may be specified upon declaration to be of storage class auto.  However, it is not required to use the keyword auto because by default, storage class within a block is auto.

- Automatic variables declared with initializers are initialized every time the block in which they are declared is entered or accessed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main( )
{
  auto int j = 1;
  {
    auto int j = 2;
    {
      auto int j = 3;
      printf(" %d ", j);
    }
    printf("\t %d ",j);
  }
  printf("%d\n", j);

  return 0;
}
```

Output: `3 2 1`

## extern

In some applications it may be useful to have data which is accessible from within any block and/or which remains in existence for the entire execution of the program.  Such variables are called global variables, and the C language provides storage classes which can meet these requirements; namely, the external (extern) and static (static) classes.
Declaration for external variable is as follows: `extern int var;`

External variables may be declared outside any function block in a source code file the same way any other variable is declared; by specifying its type and name (extern keyword may be omitted). But say an variable is defined in file1.c and used in file2.c and file3.c then the `extern` keyword must be used in file2.c and file3.c.

The scope of external variables is global, i.e. the entire source code in the file following the declarations. All functions following the declaration may access the external variable by using its name.  However, if a local variable having the same name is declared within a function, references to the name will access the local variable cell.

External variables may be initialized in declarations just as automatic variables; however, the initializers must be constant expressions. The initialization is done only once at compile time, i.e. when memory is allocated for the variables. In general, it is a good programming practice to avoid using external variables as they destroy the concept of a function as a 'black box' or independent module.


* main.c
  
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  extern int i;

  int main() 
  {
     printf("value of the external integer is = %d\n", i);
     
     return 0;
  }
  ```

* other.c

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int i=48;
  ```

Output: `value of the external integer is = 48`

## static

Static variables were completed in earlier lecture, followup question for you guys, tell me if this code is correct and will it work ?

* main.c
  
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  extern int i;

  int main() 
  {
     printf("value of the external integer is = %d\n", i);
     
     return 0;
  }
  ```

* other.c

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  static int i=48;
  ```

command: `gcc main.c other.c -o main`

It won't compile as we can't extern a static variable, as the scope of a static variable is limited only to its translation unit, i.e if defined in a function, it can be seen by other functions, similarly if defined globally in a source file other source files can't access it.
<img src="../assets/week4/static_variable_error.png">

If you recall, we get undefined reference error when we didnot include a object file of a function and used it, same happens here, as extern expects a variable defined in some other source file, but it cannot find the variable, as it is static, thus it's visibility is restricted only to the source file where it is defined, `other.c` and not `main.c`

## register

You can use the register storage class when you want to store local variables within functions or blocks in CPU registers instead of RAM to have quick access to these variables. For example, "counters" are a good candidate to be stored in the register. The variables declared using register storage class has lifespan throughout the program. 

The register storage class specifier indicates to the compiler that the object should be stored in a machine register. The register storage class specifier is typically specified for heavily used variables, such as a loop control variable, in the hopes of enhancing performance by minimizing access time. However, the compiler is not required to honor this request. Because of the limited size and number of registers available on most systems, few variables can actually be put in registers. If the compiler does not allocate a machine register for a register object, the object is treated as having the storage class specifier auto.

The following restrictions apply to the register storage class specifier:

- You cannot use pointers to reference objects that have the register storage class specifier.
- You cannot use the register storage class specifier when declaring objects in global scope.
- A register does not have an address. Therefore, you cannot apply the address operator (&) to a register variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    register int weight;
    int *ptr = &weight;
    
    return 0;
}
```

* This will give an error as follows:

  ![](../assets/week4/register_class_error.png)

Since, register doesn't have an address we cannot request it's address using `&` operator.

* The following code will work correctly:

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() 
  {
      register int weight = 89;

      printf("%d\n", weight);
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  Output: `89`

# Byte ordering

Little and big endian are two ways of storing multibyte data-types ( int, float, etc). In little endian machines, last byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first. On the other hand, in big endian machines, first byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first.

![](../assets/week4/endian.gif)

Let's see an example:

```c
int *i; // pointer to an int (4 bytes on 32-bit machine)
i = 0;  // points to location zero, so *i is the value there
```

What is the value of i?

Big endian machine: An int is 4 bytes, and the first is the largest. I read 4 bytes (W X Y Z) and W is the largest. The number is 0x12345678.
Little endian machine: Sure, an int is 4 bytes, but the first is smallest. I also read W X Y Z, but W belongs way in the back -- it's the littlest. The number is 0x78563412.

Use this code to check endianness on your computer

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
int main()  
{ 
   unsigned int i = 1; 
   char *c = (char*)&i; 
   if (*c)     
       printf("Little endian"); 
   else
       printf("Big endian"); 
   getchar(); 
   return 0; 
} 
```
